Main:
    Its only purpose is to start the server, setting the port and the quit command
  
Server:
    It just creates a ServerSocket to accept connections from clients and starts the ClientHandler

RobustServer:
    Inherits the Server. It starts the RobustClientHandler, instead of the ClientHandler.
    It's more robust than the simple Server because it handles errors.
    (IS IT ENOUGH? (IN TERMS OF HANDLING ERRORS))
    (IS IT REALLY NECESSARY TO HAVE THE SERVER AND THE ROBUSTSERVER? OR IS BETTER TO HAVE JUST THE ROBUSTSERVER?)

ClientHandler:
    This class extends Thread. It creates a bufferedReader and a BufferedWriter for each thread (it's necessary because every thread could be different socket) and communicates with the
    Client.
    (IT HAS TO BE IMPLEMENTED THE RIGHT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN SERVER AND CLIENT)
    (HAVE I TO EXECUTE THE FLUSH EVERY TIME IN THE BUFFEREDWRITER?)

RpbustClientHandler:
    Inherits the ClientHandler. It communicates with the Client.
    It's more robust than the simple ClientHandler because it handles errors.
    (IS IT ENOUGH? (IN TERMS OF HANDLING ERRORS))
    (IS IT REALLY NECESSARY TO HAVE THE CLIENTHANDLER AND THE ROBUSTCLIENTHANDLER? OR IS BETTER TO HAVE JUST THE ROBUSTCLIENTHANDLER?)
